# Tesseract-JAX examples

This directory contains example Tesseract configurations, notebooks. and scripts demonstrating how to use Tesseract-JAX in various contexts. Each example is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Examples

- [Simple](simple/demo.ipynb): A basic example of using Tesseract-JAX with a simple vector addition task. It demonstrates how to build a Tesseract and execute it within JAX.
- [CFD](cfd/demo.ipynb): A more complex example demonstrating how to use Tesseract-JAX to differentiate through a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in an optimization context.
