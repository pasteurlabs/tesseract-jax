# Tesseract-JAX

Tesseract-JAX is a lightweight extension to [Tesseract Core](https://github.com/pasteurlabs/tesseract-core) that makes Tesseracts look and feel like regular [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) primitives, and makes them jittable, differentiable, and composable.

The API of Tesseract-JAX consists of a single function, [`apply_tesseract(tesseract_client, inputs)`](tesseract_jax.apply_tesseract), which is fully traceable by JAX. This enables end-to-end autodifferentiation and JIT compilation of Tesseract-based pipelines:

```python
@jax.jit
def vector_sum(x, y):
    res = apply_tesseract(vectoradd_tesseract, {"a": {"v": x}, "b": {"v": y}})
    return res["vector_add"]["result"].sum()

jax.grad(vector_sum)(x, y) # ðŸŽ‰
```
